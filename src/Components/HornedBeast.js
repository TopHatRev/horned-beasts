        The Nubian ibex (Capra nubiana) is a desert-dwelling goat species (Genus
        Capra) found in mountainous areas of northern and northeast Africa, and
        the Middle East. It was historically considered to be a subspecies of
        the Alpine ibex (C. ibex), but is now considered a distinct species. The
        wild population is estimated at 4,500 mature individuals.
